#hmwk:
# Flesh out the Hangman program we started in class.
# Complete any TODOs to add:
  # A greeting for the user.
  # A prompt that tells the user the partially completed word. It may also do
    # input validation (make sure they give a letter) or state the number of
    # remaining turns.
  # A game over state that tells the player if they won or lost and tells them
    # the word they were trying to guess.

# BONUS: Prompt the player to play another game and continue until they quit.
# BONUS: ASCII art everywhere! ASCII logo, ASCII hangman status!

## BEWARE THE SEMICOLON!
